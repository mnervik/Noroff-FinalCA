  <h2 style="text-align: left">About</h2>
  <div id="about-text" style="text-align: left">
    First published in 1993 by Wizards of the Coast, Somthing was the first trading card game produced and it continues
    to
    thrive, with approximately twenty million players as of 2015. Somthing can be played by two or more players in
    various
    formats, which fall into one of two categories: constructed or limited. Limited formats involve players building a
    deck spontaneously out of a pool of random cards with a minimum deck size of 40 cards. The other major category of
    formats is constructed. In constructed, players created decks from cards they own, usually 60 cards with no more
    than
    4 of any given card. Somthing is played in person with printed cards, or using a deck of virtual cards through the
    Internet-based Somthing: The Gathering Online, or on a smartphone or tablet, or through other programs.
    <br>
    Each game represents a battle between wizards known as "planeswalkers", who employ spells, artifacts, and creatures
    depicted on individual Somthing cards to defeat their opponents. Although the original concept of the game drew
    heavily from the motifs of traditional fantasy role-playing games such as Dungeons Dragons, the gameplay of Somthing
    bears little similarity to pencil-and-paper adventure games, while having substantially more cards and more complex
    rules than many other card games.
    <br>

    New cards are released on a regular basis through expansion sets. An organized tournament system played at an
    international level and a worldwide community of professional Somthing players has developed, as well as a
    substantial
    secondary market for Somthing cards. Certain Somthing cards can be valuable due to their rarity and utility in game
    play, with prices ranging from a few cents to thousands of dollars.

    Each player starts the game with 20 life. Knock your opponent down to 0 life, and you win. The most common way to do
    this is to summon creatures and attack with them.
    <br>
    Creature cards are the most important part of many Magic decks. They’re really easy to spot—just look at the lower
    right of a card. If you see a pair of numbers separated by a slash, you’ve got a creature card. Once it’s on the
    battlefield, a creature continues to attack and defend for you until your opponent can find a way to take it out.
    <br>
    Most games become a race to see who can deal the most damage first. Summoning the best creatures will help you win
    that race every time. Check out the section on casting creature spells.
